    <string name="hrs_about_text">A thesis project on designing and developing the first smart wearable ring for people who suffer from Raynaud`s.
        It monitors three temperatures: environment, finger skin, and temperature object in contact. By monitoring these changes we can provide meaningful data that could visualize the frequency, duration and severity of one`s Raynaud`s phenomenon.
        Effortlessly, seamlessly as long as it`s worn on a the sensitive finger. Alerts on attacks, Coaching to take actions and precautions, Sharing data with your doctor or the large community of sufferers, Helping you understand the reasons and effects. This is a project by Konstantinos Partheniadis, 23.</string>
